* Without flag:

## Questions
1. How this code can sort number from smaller to larger
 
Answer: check condition(num[i]>num[i+1]) and switching two number until array number was sort to   smaller to larger.

2. What if two numbers equal, what will happen? 

Answer: not issue and it will run next loop

3. How many times at line 24 will be executed (as a function of the size of input) 

Answer: when input array sort smaller to larger , it will run n-1 AND when input array sort larger to  smaller , it will run n(n-1)

4. Why we need flag variable ? 

Answer: Because it control loop and save time to run 

5. When we remove the flag variable, the code will run faster or slower? in which scenario? 

Answer:
